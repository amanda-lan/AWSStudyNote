VPC NOTES

One subnet equalls to one avalibility zone.
By default, AWS allow 5 VPCs per region.
VPC Flow Logs can be created at the VPC, subnet, and network interface levels.
You may have only one Internet Gateway per VPC.
You may peer a VPC to another VPC that’s in your same account, or to any VPC in any other account.
When you create a custom VPC, a default Security Group, Access control List, and Route Table are created automaticaly. You must create your own subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway (if you need one.)
???A Bastion host allows you to securely administer (via SSH or RDP) an EC2 instance located in a private subnet. Don’t confuse Bastions and NATs, which allow outside traffic to reach an instance in a private subnet.???
Security Groups are stateful and Network Access Control Lists are stateless.
